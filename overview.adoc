This guide shows you how to build a sample app doing various things
with "social login" using https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth2]
and http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot]. It starts
with a simple, single-provider single-sign on, and works up to a
self-hosted OAuth2 Authorization Server with a choice of
authentication providers (https://developers.facebook.com[Facebook] or
https://developer.github.com/[Github]). The samples are all
single-page apps using Spring Boot and Spring OAuth on the back
end. They also all use https://angularjs.org/[AngularJS] on the front
end, but the changes needed to convert to a different JavaScript
framework or to use server side rendering would be minimal.

There are several samples building on each other adding new features:

* <<_social_login_simple,**simple**>>: a very basic static app with just a home page and
unconditional login through via Spring Boot's `@EnableOAuth2Sso` (if
you visit the home page you will be automatically redirected to
Facebook).

* <<_social_login_click,**click**>>: adds an explicit link that the user has to click to
login.

* <<_social_login_logout,**logout**>>: adds a logout link as well for authenticated users.

* <<_social_login_manual,**manual**>>: shows how the `@EnableOAuth2Sso` works by unpicking it
and configuring all its pieces manually.

* <<_social_login_github,**gitub**>>: adds a second login provider in Github, so the user can
choose on the home page which one to use.

* <<_social_login_authserver,**auth-server**>>: turns the app into a fully-fledged OAuth2
Authorization Server, able to issue its own tokens, but still using
the external OAuth2 providers for authentication.

Each of them can be imported into an IDE and there is a main class
`SocialApplication` that you can run there to start the apps. They all
come up with a home page on http://localhost:8080 (and all require
that you have at least a Facebook account if you want to log in and
see the content). You can also run all the apps on the command line
using `mvn spring-boot:run` or by building the jar file and running it
with `mvn package` and `java -jar target/*.jar` (per the
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application-run[Spring
Boot docs] and other
https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/[available
documentation]). There is no need to install Maven if you use the
https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[wrapper] at the top level,
e.g.

```
$ cd simple
$ ../mvnw package
$ java -jar target/*.jar
```

NOTE: The apps all work on `localhost:8080` because they use OAuth2
clients registered with Facebook and Github for that address. To run
them on a different host or port, you need to register your own apps
and put the credentials in the config files. There is no danger of
leaking your Facebook or Github credentials beyond localhost if you
use the default values, but be careful what you expose on the
internet, and don't put your own app registrations in public source
control.
