[[_social_login_click]]
= Add a Welcome Page

In this section we modify the <<_social_login_simple,simple>> app we
just built, by adding an explicit link to login with Facebook. Instead
of being redirected immediately, the new link will be visible on the
home page, and the user can choose to login or to stay
unauthenticated. Only when the user has clicked on the link will he be
shown the secure content.
